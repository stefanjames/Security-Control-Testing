# Security Control Testing (AC-11) Using FedRAMP Template (Determine-if Levels)

Step-by-step guide on how to perform Hands-On Security Control Testing for AC-11 using the FedRAMP Test Case Template with Determine-if Levels. AC-11 focuses on session lock controls.

## Introduction

FedRAMP standardizes the security assessment and authorization process for cloud products and services. AC-11 addresses session lock controls. Ensure you have the necessary access rights and authorization before proceeding.

## Prerequisites

6. **Execute Test Cases**:
   - Observe and examine the Access Control Policy noted that the AC-11 verbiage defined the time period of inactivity of 15 minutes (900 seconds).

7. **Record Observations and Findings**:
   - Document observations and findings during the tests.

8. **Evaluate the Results**:
   - Compare findings to Determine-if level expectations.

9. **Report the Test Results**:
   - Complete the Test Case Template reporting sections.

10. **Review and Validation**:
    - Have findings reviewed and validated by a qualified security assessor.

11. **Mitigation and Remediation**:
    - Develop and implement plans to address any deficiencies.

12. **Document the Final Report**:
    - Generate a comprehensive final report detailing results and actions taken.

13. **Submit the Report**:
    - Submit the report to the relevant governing body for assessment and authorization.

14. **Continuous Monitoring**:
    - Regularly assess and review session lock controls to maintain compliance.

15. **Follow Up**:
    - Continuously update the system to ensure ongoing compliance with AC-11 and other security requirements.

## Reporting

Ensure your report contains details of tests, outcomes, and any actions to address deficiencies.

## Continuous Monitoring

Maintain continuous monitoring of session lock controls to uphold FedRAMP compliance.

## Conclusion

FedRAMP compliance is an ongoing process. Stay informed about updates in FedRAMP guidelines and adjust your security controls accordingly.
